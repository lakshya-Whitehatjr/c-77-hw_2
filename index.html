        <h2 class="sub">About Visual Studio...</h2> 
        <h4 class="text">Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) developed by Microsoft to develop GUI(Graphical User Interface), console, Web applications, web apps, mobile apps, cloud, and web services, etc.
             With the help of this IDE, you can create managed code as well as native code. It uses the various platforms of Microsoft software development software like Windows store, Microsoft Silverlight, and Windows API, etc.
              It is not a language-specific IDE as you can use this to write code in C#, C++, VB(Visual Basic), Python, JavaScript, and many more languages.
               It provides support for 36 different programming languages.
               It is available for Windows as well as for macOS. </h4>

               <h3 class="sub">What is A Console?</h3>
               <h4 class="text"> Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows.
                    An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer.
                    It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen).  </h4>
                    <h3 class="sub">Why is it used?</h3>
                    A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard.
                     It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input.
                      While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.
